		<p>A few days ago I presented my talk, &ldquo;Corporation In The Middle&rdquo; at <a href="http://sector.ca">SecTor 2014</a>.  I will be presenting an updated and truncated version of the talk at <a href="http://www.bsidesto.ca/">BSides Toronto</a> in November of this year.</p>

<p>If you are interested in seeing the talk you can do so here:</p>

<p>If so inclined, you can also <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/LeeBrotherston/lee-brotherston-corporation-in-the-middle">get the slides here</a>.</p>

<br />


<p>The original blurb was:
<i>My ISP deliberately MiTM&rsquo;d my connection.  This talk discusses how they did it, how I detected what they did and what this means.  This talk covers what I learnt over three months of analysis focusing on the technology involved both on the ISP side and my own. I cover in detail how I went about identifying and mapping the ISPs hidden network components and how they modify IP connections. I will briefly cover what this means to customers of their service.  During the talk I will provide technical evidence as well as walk through how I used open source tools to unmask this Corp In The Middle attack.

		<p>A couple of days ago I tweeted this:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure when your EULA prohibits reverse engineering your software, all you prevent is people telling you that they reversed it.</p>&mdash; leE Brotherston (@leEb_public) <a href="https://twitter.com/leEb_public/statuses/489050821649506304">July 15, 2014</a></blockquote>

</center>


<p>Quite a lot of people agreed (at the time of writing it has 40 retweets and 19 favourites, which is quite a lot for me), so I thought that I would expand and explain this in a little more detail.

		<p>I was meant to start this blog with a post about my ISP, about how they had man in the middle&rsquo;d my connection and how I had been working out the details of why they had been doing this, how they achieved it and how I uncovered what they had been up to.</p>

<p>Since I started writing that post the topic has grown somewhat and now I have been confirmed as a <a href="http://sector.ca/Program/Sessions/Session-Details/evl/0/tag/16752/Lee-Brotherston">speaker at SecTor 2014</a> in Toronto.</p>

<p>So, the post is still coming&hellip;  But if you want to see me explain it in as much Powerpoint glory as I can muster, come on down to SecTor later this year :)</p>

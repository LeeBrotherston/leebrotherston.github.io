	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For anyone that has read this blog before, you will probably know that at the end of 2014 I gave my &ldquo;Corporation in The Middle&rdquo; talk at both <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2014/10/29/corporation-in-the-middle/">SecTor</a> and <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2014/12/29/bsides-toronto-video-and-slides/">BSides Toronto</a>.  In short my ISP (<a href="http://www.rogers.com">Rogers</a>) used a platform to Man (Corporation) in The Middle my and every other customers connection in order to insert notification banners at the top of pages in certain circumstances, such approaching your bandwidth cap.  I argued during my &ldquo;What Could Possibly Go Wrong?&rdquo; section that even if my ISP was completely well intentioned that the mere presence of this platform presented a risk to customers.  What would happen if they had a rogue member of staff, became coerced in some way or were hacked?  A malicious 3rd party could use their platform to inject javascript to drop 0-day or socially engineer users with fake Flash or Java updates, for example.</p>

<p>Then last night I read the article <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/nsa-trying-to-map-rogers-rbc-communications-traffic-leak-shows/article23491118/">NSA trying to map Rogers, RBC communications traffic, leak shows</a> in The Globe and Mail.  It describes a leaked NSA document entitled <i>“Private Networks: Analysis, Contextualization and Setting the Vision”</i>, the article goes on to say <i>&ldquo;A comparison of this document with previous Snowden leaks suggests it may be a preliminary step in broad efforts to identify, study and, if deemed necessary, “exploit” organizations’ internal communication networks.&rdquo;</i>.  Of course there are no details as to if this ever came to pass and if it did to what degree any penetration took place, however I believe that this does indeed demonstrate that my fears were not completely unfounded.</p>

<p>If anybody were to penetrate the networks of any ISPs running tools such as this, these injection/interception platforms provide an easy mechanism to attack the customer base en mass.  To provide an indication of scale Perftech, the manufacturer of the platform used by my ISP, published in January that their <a href="http://www.perftech.com/newsroom/perftech-adds-telco-giant-roster-q4-grows-subscriber-reach-30-2014/">overall subscriber reach is currently 19.5 million</a>, and that&rsquo;s just one manufacturer.</p>

<p>There are many platforms that &ldquo;legitimately&rdquo; Man in The Middle our communications, however, unless properly managed and secured they can become a very useful tool in an adversaries arsenal.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Recently I have made some brief posts on the <a href="https://github.com/LeeBrotherston/snort">Snort/Suricata rules</a> that I wrote to detect <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2015/02/20/superfish-detection/">SuperFish</a> and <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2015/02/23/privdog-detection/">PrivDog</a>, two pieces of Crapware/Malware/Adware/PUP that insert themselves as a Certificate Authority in the local browsers and proceed to Man in the Middle HTTPS traffic for the purposes of injecting ads.</p>

<p>In those posts I mentioned that CipherSuite fingerprinting was the key to creating the rules, however I didn&rsquo;t give a very comprehensive technical blow-by-blow.  So, now I have a new rule to add having noticed another application Man in the Middle&#8217;ing browsers (<a href="http://geniusbox.net/">GeniusBox</a>) using the same technique, it seems like an apt time to write up what I have been doing in a more useful way.

For those who are interested, the ciphersuites used by the PrivDog client are:

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Much has been in the press the past couple of days regarding Superfish, specifically being pre-installed on Lenovo hardware, however the issues discussed are relevant to any device with Superfish installed.  It just so happens that Lenovo made the decision to bundle it up in the factory.</p>

<p>There are a number of write-ups on the technical nature of this malware/adware, and I won&rsquo;t attempt to rehash those, they are most likely better than anything that I could contribute anyway.  I did however want to be able to detect this on the network to offer network administrators a chance to locate devices on their network which may be affected.</p>

<p>By creating <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/make-your-own-superfish-infected-vm/">a Superfish infected VM</a> we can examine how the software works in a relatively controlled fashion.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>With all the talk of <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/02/19/superfish_lenovo_spyware/">Lenovo</a> and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/lenovo-pcs-ship-with-man-in-the-middle-adware-that-breaks-https-connections/">Superfish</a> in the press, now seems a good time to mention an update which is personal to me on the topic of Man in The Middle attacks.</p>

<p>People have asked me how widespread the <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2014/10/29/corporation-in-the-middle/">man in the middle attempts made my by ISP</a> actually are.  Well thankfully the manufacturer of the equipment used has put out a press statement around their current &ldquo;subscriber reach&rdquo; which you can read in full <a href="http://www.perftech.com/newsroom/perftech-adds-telco-giant-roster-q4-grows-subscriber-reach-30-2014/">here</a>.  The important paragraph for us is this:</p>

<blockquote><p>New-customer wins along with existing-customer expansions for 2014 resulted in a substantial increase in the aggregate subscriber reach across all PerfTech’s ISP customers.  Previously at roughly 15 million subscribers, that total climbed to approximately 19.5 million for 2014, a gain of 30%.</p></blockquote>


<p>If these figures are to be believed, that&rsquo;s 19.5 million subscribers.  By my understanding a subscriber is a connection (e.g. one cable or DSL line), not a single device so the total user count is probably significantly higher.</p>

		<p>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/sandbox-exec.1.html">sandbox feature on OS X</a> is really useful for restricting what applications have access to in more granular and controlled fashion than standard file permissions allow.  However writing the initial sandbox profile can be problematic for many users, it&rsquo;s not always clear what an application needs access to in order to operate in the expected way; there are a number of system files, libraries and such like, that an application quite rightly needs to read.</p>

<p>The news is not all bad, there are some really useful commands built in to OS X which can help.

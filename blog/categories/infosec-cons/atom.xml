    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was meant to start this blog with a post about my ISP, about how they had man in the middle&rsquo;d my connection and how I had been working out the details of why they had been doing this, how they achieved it and how I uncovered what they had been up to.</p>

<p>Since I started writing that post the topic has grown somewhat and now I have been confirmed as a <a href="http://sector.ca/Program/Sessions/Session-Details/evl/0/tag/16752/Lee-Brotherston">speaker at SecTor 2014</a> in Toronto.</p>

<p>So, the post is still coming&hellip;  But if you want to see me explain it in as much Powerpoint glory as I can muster, come on down to SecTor later this year :)</p>

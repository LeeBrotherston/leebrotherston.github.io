    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For anyone that has read this blog before, you will probably know that at the end of 2014 I gave my &ldquo;Corporation in The Middle&rdquo; talk at both <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2014/10/29/corporation-in-the-middle/">SecTor</a> and <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2014/12/29/bsides-toronto-video-and-slides/">BSides Toronto</a>.  In short my ISP (<a href="http://www.rogers.com">Rogers</a>) used a platform to Man (Corporation) in The Middle my and every other customers connection in order to insert notification banners at the top of pages in certain circumstances, such approaching your bandwidth cap.  I argued during my &ldquo;What Could Possibly Go Wrong?&rdquo; section that even if my ISP was completely well intentioned that the mere presence of this platform presented a risk to customers.  What would happen if they had a rogue member of staff, became coerced in some way or were hacked?  A malicious 3rd party could use their platform to inject javascript to drop 0-day or socially engineer users with fake Flash or Java updates, for example.</p>

<p>Then last night I read the article <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/nsa-trying-to-map-rogers-rbc-communications-traffic-leak-shows/article23491118/">NSA trying to map Rogers, RBC communications traffic, leak shows</a> in The Globe and Mail.  It describes a leaked NSA document entitled <i>“Private Networks: Analysis, Contextualization and Setting the Vision”</i>, the article goes on to say <i>&ldquo;A comparison of this document with previous Snowden leaks suggests it may be a preliminary step in broad efforts to identify, study and, if deemed necessary, “exploit” organizations’ internal communication networks.&rdquo;</i>.  Of course there are no details as to if this ever came to pass and if it did to what degree any penetration took place, however I believe that this does indeed demonstrate that my fears were not completely unfounded.</p>

<p>If anybody were to penetrate the networks of any ISPs running tools such as this, these injection/interception platforms provide an easy mechanism to attack the customer base en mass.  To provide an indication of scale Perftech, the manufacturer of the platform used by my ISP, published in January that their <a href="http://www.perftech.com/newsroom/perftech-adds-telco-giant-roster-q4-grows-subscriber-reach-30-2014/">overall subscriber reach is currently 19.5 million</a>, and that&rsquo;s just one manufacturer.</p>

<p>There are many platforms that &ldquo;legitimately&rdquo; Man in The Middle our communications, however, unless properly managed and secured they can become a very useful tool in an adversaries arsenal.</p>

    <id>http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2015/03/04/quick-and-dirty-crapware-analysis-ids-rule-creation-foo</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I have made some brief posts on the <a href="https://github.com/LeeBrotherston/snort">Snort/Suricata rules</a> that I wrote to detect <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2015/02/20/superfish-detection/">SuperFish</a> and <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2015/02/23/privdog-detection/">PrivDog</a>, two pieces of Crapware/Malware/Adware/PUP that insert themselves as a Certificate Authority in the local browsers and proceed to Man in the Middle HTTPS traffic for the purposes of injecting ads.</p>

<p>In those posts I mentioned that CipherSuite fingerprinting was the key to creating the rules, however I didn&rsquo;t give a very comprehensive technical blow-by-blow.  So, now I have a new rule to add having noticed another application Man in the Middle'ing browsers (<a href="http://geniusbox.net/">GeniusBox</a>) using the same technique, it seems like an apt time to write up what I have been doing in a more useful way.<!-- more --></p>

<p>Although many of these miscreant applications insert scripts into webpages that are hosted on remote sources, they all conduct their Man in the Middle attacks on the local machine.  The chosen technique is to, either via network hooks or by setting browsers to use localhost as a proxy, ensure that the connection from the browser is terminated locally and a connection to the webserver is made via their &ldquo;application&rdquo;.  They don&rsquo;t hide this, it is trivial to spot with some ghetto forensics.</p>

<p>First we can use <code>netstat -ano</code> to look at the connections and associated pid&rsquo;s on the local host.  Notice how PID 3388 is making a local connection to a listening PID 4084 on port 49546?  Also note that PID 4084 is also making a number of connections to external hosts on ports 80 (http) and 443 (https):</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.squarelemon.com/images/upload/netstat.png"></p>

<p>By looking at the details tab on taskmanager we can see which executable names those pids pertain to.  In this case it&rsquo;s iexplore.exe (Internet Explorer) and Client.exe (<a href="http://geniusbox.net/">GeniusBox</a>):</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.squarelemon.com/images/upload/taskman.png"></p>

<p>Finally, by looking at the process details in Task Manager we can see which directory the binary resides in and can look at that location to see if it really is the app we suspect it is:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.squarelemon.com/images/upload/install_dir.png"></p>

<p>Certainly looks that way!</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s do some CipherSuite fingerprinting and see if we can create a new snort rule.</p>

<p>First we need to sniff the connection, this is easy, I have installed the application in question inside a virtual machine and so can sniff on one of the virtual interfaces using tcpdump/wireshark/t-shark/whatever on my host OS.  I sniff web browsing traffic both before and after I infect the host on as many browsers as I wish to test (in this case Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome).  Remember this is SSL so in theory you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to decrypt the traffic and determine what the user agent string is (of course with a MiTM attack if you have the private certs it&rsquo;s entirely possible, as is the case if <a href="https://jimshaver.net/2015/02/11/decrypting-tls-browser-traffic-with-wireshark-the-easy-way/">the browser is configured to save the ssl keys</a>); I would recommend a separate pcap file for each browser both before and after (6 in total in this case) to keep analysis easy.</p>

<p>Each of the captures can be loaded into WireShark in turn for easy analysis (other packet capture tools will show the info too, but WireShark just makes it easy), the hex is helpfully highlighted at the bottom so we know which data to include in a snort/suricata rule:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.squarelemon.com/images/upload/wireshark.png" style="border: 1px solid #000000;"></p>

<p>The list is not only the supported Cipher Suites, it is also in preference order.  My research thus far shows the the combination of supported Cipher Suites, preference order and total number of suites offered is fairly unique to each browser family.  It remains static between each connection that the browser makes, this is not a per-session variable.</p>

<p>When looking at <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2015/02/20/superfish-detection/">SuperFish</a> and <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2015/02/23/privdog-detection/">PrivDog</a> I noticed that the 3 browsers all had their own fingerprints prior to infection, but exhibited the same (fourth) fingerprint when intercepted by the applications.  Presumably because the applications terminate SSL locally (resigning it with with their own CA that they installed) and they need to implement a (fourth) SSL client of their own to make the outbound connection to the real webserver, and we can detect that.</p>

<p>Why is this useful?  Network administrators often do not have a handle on exactly what is on their network, BYOD and other initiatives mean that self-prodcured of self-managed devices are prevalent in many environments.  For this reason desktop management systems may not be aware of the presence of these applications, but an IDS/IPS platform can detect them based on network traffic using this technique.  Furthermore, web server administrators can detect on this signature in order to determine if one of their clients (someone browsing to their website) has been affected and potentially warn/block them as desired.  Of course there is always the possibility that someone malicious could detect this for other reasons, but that&rsquo;s a whole other post ;)</p>

<p>We can simply take the hex from WireShark and use that as the &ldquo;content&rdquo; for a snort/suricata rule.  Furthermore we can use an offset statement to reduce the chances that we are just picking up the same string of bytes reoccurring in some other context.  The Cipher Suite list in the Client Hello packet is a fixed length from the start of the packet contents.  Using these two details we are able to create a rule:</p>

<p><code>alert tcp any any &ndash;> any 443 (msg:&ldquo;GeniusBox Cipher Suite Profile Matched&rdquo;; flow:to_server; reference:url,<a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/LeeBrotherston/523ffbc02f2407fd213c/raw/008b77bab61d26761119f07d518779ed6edfbd74/sid:1000006;">https://gist.githubusercontent.com/LeeBrotherston/523ffbc02f2407fd213c/raw/008b77bab61d26761119f07d518779ed6edfbd74/sid:1000006;</a> content:&ldquo;|00 18 c0 14 c0 13 00 35 00 2f c0 0a c0 09 00 38 00 32 00 0a 00 13 00 05 00 04|&rdquo;; offset: 44; sid:1000006; rev:1;)</code></p>

<p>(The content also includes the proceeding two bytes which is the ciphersuites length field)</p>

<p>The next phase is to test the rules, but that will be a post of it&rsquo;s own (stay tuned!)</p>

<p>I have added this to <a href="https://github.com/LeeBrotherston/snort">my snort/suricata rules for interception detection</a> which also include coverage for <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2015/02/20/superfish-detection/">SuperFish</a>, <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2015/02/23/privdog-detection/">PrivDog</a> and the techniques described in my <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2014/12/29/bsides-toronto-video-and-slides/">Corporation in the Middle talk</a>.</p>

<p>Any feedback on the rules are greatly appreciated.  Especially if anyone has particular successes to share of failures to highlight that I can use to improve the accuracy.

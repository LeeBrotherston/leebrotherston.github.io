    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago I presented my talk, &ldquo;Corporation In The Middle&rdquo; at <a href="http://sector.ca">SecTor 2014</a>.  I will be presenting an updated and truncated version of the talk at <a href="http://www.bsidesto.ca/">BSides Toronto</a> in November of this year.</p>

<p>If you are interested in seeing the talk you can do so here:</p>

<p>The original blurb was:
<i>My ISP deliberately MiTM&rsquo;d my connection.  This talk discusses how they did it, how I detected what they did and what this means.  This talk covers what I learnt over three months of analysis focusing on the technology involved both on the ISP side and my own. I cover in detail how I went about identifying and mapping the ISPs hidden network components and how they modify IP connections. I will briefly cover what this means to customers of their service.  During the talk I will provide technical evidence as well as walk through how I used open source tools to unmask this Corp In The Middle attack.

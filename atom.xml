    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With all the talk of <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/02/19/superfish_lenovo_spyware/">Lenovo</a> and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/lenovo-pcs-ship-with-man-in-the-middle-adware-that-breaks-https-connections/">Superfish</a> in the press, now seems a good time to mention an update which is personal to me on the topic of Man in The Middle attacks.</p>

<p>People have asked me how widespread the <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2014/10/29/corporation-in-the-middle/">man in the middle attempts made my by ISP</a> actually are.  Well thankfully the manufacturer of the equipment used has put out a press statement around their current &ldquo;subscriber reach&rdquo; which you can read in full <a href="http://www.perftech.com/newsroom/perftech-adds-telco-giant-roster-q4-grows-subscriber-reach-30-2014/">here</a>.  The important paragraph for us is this:</p>

<blockquote><p>New-customer wins along with existing-customer expansions for 2014 resulted in a substantial increase in the aggregate subscriber reach across all PerfTechâ€™s ISP customers.  Previously at roughly 15 million subscribers, that total climbed to approximately 19.5 million for 2014, a gain of 30%.</p></blockquote>


<p>If these figures are to be believed, that&rsquo;s 19.5 million subscribers.  By my understanding a subscriber is a connection (e.g. one cable or DSL line), not a single device so the total user count is probably significantly higher.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2015/02/10/os-x-sandbox-quickstart/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-10T10:30:14-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2015/02/10/os-x-sandbox-quickstart</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/sandbox-exec.1.html">sandbox feature on OS X</a> is really useful for restricting what applications have access to in more granular and controlled fashion than standard file permissions allow.  However writing the initial sandbox profile can be problematic for many users, it&rsquo;s not always clear what an application needs access to in order to operate in the expected way; there are a number of system files, libraries and such like, that an application quite rightly needs to read.</p>

<p>The news is not all bad, there are some really useful commands built in to OS X which can help.<!-- More --></p>

<p>Working on the assumption that the threat model that we are protecting against is an application being exploited via a vulnerability or such like (rather than this being a malicious app out of the box), we can run the application without restrictions initially all the while logging which it accesses.  To do this we create a nearly blank sandbox profile which does nothing but log:</p>

<blockquote><p>(version 1)<br/>(trace &#8220;/tmp/trace_output.sb&#8221;)</p></blockquote>


<p>Next we can run our application via sandbox-exec using this sandbox profile:</p>

<blockquote><p>sandbox-exec -f ./trace.sb /Applications/SomeApplication.app/Contents/MacOS/SomeApplication</p></blockquote>


<p>The application will run slowly, it is after all tracing (logging) every access to a file along with the type of access (read, write, read/write, read metadata, etc) along with other information like accesses to sysctl variables.  This will generate the file /tmp/trace_output.sb which is a working, though huge and inelegant, sandbox profile.  Simply running vim (without even opening a file) will create a 238 line profile (imagine what a browser does).  This can easily be trimmed by sandbox-simplify:</p>

<blockquote><p>sandbox-simplify /tmp/trace_output.sb > ./tracesimple.sb</p></blockquote>


<p>What this essentially does is the sandbox profile equivalent of sort | uniq and then groups the output to be a little easier to read.  This takes the sample vim profile down to 41 lines from the 238 lines it was before.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s test if that worked:</p>

<blockquote><p>sandbox-exec -f tracesimple.sb /Applications/SomeApplication.app/Contents/MacOS/SomeApplication</p></blockquote>


<p>The application should now run as expected but have access to nothing outside of what was specified in the sandbox profile.  In the case of the vim example, the code runs as expected but has no permission to open any documents (try opening a file); we have sandboxing \o/</p>

<p>Of course running an application which cannot interact with the filesystem may not be entirely useful, especially for a tool such as vim.  At this point we can begin manually editing the sandbox profile.  We can add additional permissions that we wish to use to ensure that the application can open files that we want it to.  The system has a selection of example profile that you may wish to borrow from in <i>/System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles/</i> alternatively I found <a href="http://reverse.put.as/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Apple-Sandbox-Guide-v1.0.pdf">this guide</a> really useful.</p>

<p>Of course you may wish to tweak or debug permissions further, this is easy, just add <i>(trace &ldquo;/tmp/trace_output.sb&rdquo;)</i> to your sandbox profile as we did at the start and you will create a trace file for any additional permissions which may be required.  Enjoy!</p>

    <updated>2015-01-27T09:33:16-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2015/01/27/citm-snort-rules</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year I gave my Corporation In The Middle talk in which I explained how my ISP has been man-in-the-middle&#8217;ing my connection to inject a warning banner into the top of webpages I visited (talk content <a href="blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2014/10/29/corporation-in-the-middle/">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2014/12/29/bsides-toronto-video-and-slides/">here</a>).</p>

<p>Part of this involved traffic analysis to discover artifacts of the injection process.  In an effort to make this process more automated, repeatable and accessible I have put together a few snort rules to allow others to alert on this condition:<br /></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/LeeBrotherston/snort"><a href="https://github.com/LeeBrotherston/snort">https://github.com/LeeBrotherston/snort</a></a><br /></p>

<p>One rule is commented out as it is noisy and prone to false positives, however I have included it (disabled) for now, for reference.  The other three rules have been tested by me on my personal environment and seem to be free from false positives, however this is only a limited test and so feedback would be really appreciated from anyone running them elsewhere.<br /></p>

<p>Of course these are far from complete in terms of detection of man in the middle generically, they only pertain to the specific technique outlined in my talk, however I will endeavour to update them as I obtain further information.</p>

<br />


<p>I started to wonder if they were using the same technique that I had recently been researching and discussing in my <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2014/10/29/corporation-in-the-middle/">Corporation in The Middle</a> talk.  Luckily for me, my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/benjammingh/">Benjammingh</a> was one of those who noticed and was currently on a Gogo flight, so I asked him to take a packetdump for analysis.<br /><br /><!-- More --></p>

<p>The short summary is that this is not the same technique, in fact this looks like in-flight transparent proxying&hellip;.<br /><br /></p>

<p>For one thing there is this giveaway in the http response header:<br /></p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>X-Cache: MISS from 172.19.134.2
</span><span class='line'>X-Cache-Lookup: MISS from 172.19.134.2:3128
</span><span class='line'>Via: 1.0 172.19.134.2:3128 (squid/2.6.STABLE14)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<br />


<p>This is indeed squid, quite an old install of squid, on the default port.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Secondly, the TTL on all the packets was 64.  Now, most OS&rsquo;s tend to use round numbers for default TTL values (32, 64, 128).  Assuming this to be the case, this would indicate that either YouTube is exactly 64 hops away or the packets are originating from the local network segment, which would be consistent with a local (transparent) proxy.</p>

<br />


<p>It&rsquo;s hardly an in-depth analysis, but at this point it seems to be more than we have at the minute, and it would explain how they are Man in The Middle&#8217;ing the connection, the question still remains&hellip;. why?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just got a festive present from my ISP, <a href="http://www.rogers.com">Rogers</a>.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Following my <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2014/10/29/corporation-in-the-middle/">recent <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2014/12/24/bsides-toronto-video-and-slides/">talks</a> regarding ISP packet injection/interception and data collection I wrote to the privacy officer at Rogers and asked, under PIPEDA, that I be supplied all information regarding my account, including any information that they have gathered such as URLs of sites visited, etc.<br /></p>

<br />


<p>I got a fairly standard response which said that they did not collect any such data, to which I replied:<!-- More --></p>

<br />


<blockquote><p>Hi,</p><p>I recently sent a letter to you asking for details of data that Rogers hold on me as required by PIPEDA.  As expected you, or someone in your department, kindly replied.  Thank you!</p><p>Most of it made sense however I did note that there was one area in particular that is inaccurate/untrue, specifically your statement &#8220;We do not collect the IP addresses or the domain names of the sites that you have visited or the time, dates and port numbers&#8221;.  I understand it is entirely possible that this was not deliberate and it&#8217;s more likely that you are unaware of some of the data that Rogers holds, nonetheless I thought that I should mention this so that this mistake is not replicated in the future placing you in breach of PIPEDA.</p><p>To provide you some insight, when you insert consumer messaging into webpages, such as the &#8220;you have exceeded 75% of your bandwidth allowance&#8230;&#8221; message, you use a system called the Bulletin System manufactured by Perftech to do so.  Putting aside the legality of this tool (I believe this breaks the Telecommunications Act) for a moment, you should note that this tool tracks user web browsing behavior (other than encrypted sessions) and keeps a history of the past 30 days tied to user account, irrespective of if that user is receiving any messaging at the time or not.</p><p>If it helps you to track down this system, one of it&#8217;s nodes (REDACTED) is currently live on the IP REDACTED within your network.</p><p>If you would like further information on this I have a sizeable amount of documentation and evidence to support this.</p><p>Please feel free to come back to me if you have any questions or queries.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Lee</p></blockquote>

<p>The original blurb was:
<i>My ISP deliberately MiTM&rsquo;d my connection.  This talk discusses how they did it, how I detected what they did and what this means.  This talk covers what I learnt over three months of analysis focusing on the technology involved both on the ISP side and my own. I cover in detail how I went about identifying and mapping the ISPs hidden network components and how they modify IP connections. I will briefly cover what this means to customers of their service.  During the talk I will provide technical evidence as well as walk through how I used open source tools to unmask this Corp In The Middle attack.

<p>Quite a lot of people agreed (at the time of writing it has 40 retweets and 19 favourites, which is quite a lot for me), so I thought that I would expand and explain this in a little more detail.<!-- More --></p>

<p>The End User Licence Agreement (EULA) is something which is fairly common inclusion in commercial applications, and is typically something dreamed up by the legal team to attempt to enforce whatever it is that they feel needs to be added as part of the licencing agreement.  What prompted my particular comment was something I noticed in the EULA of an application I was using, which prohibited the user from being able to:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;copy, distribute, publish, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, or translate the Software&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>A <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22copy%2C+distribute%2C+publish%2C+reverse+engineer%2C+decompile%2C+disassemble%2C+modify%2C+or+translate+the+Software%22">quick search</a> seems to indicate that this is a fairly common clause in a number of EULAs, particularly in the world of gambling (maybe they all use the same template or legal team).</p>

<p>My assumption is that this clause is included in order to prevent people from creating clone clients, perhaps ones which automate betting and casino style gambling, laundering via robot card games or perhaps just an attempt to hide flaws in the application stack somewhere.</p>

<p>My initial thought was merely that this would not prevent anyone with ill intentions from reversing the code.  People who are willing to use an application or service for fraudulent means are probably committing crimes such as fraud in the process, if they&rsquo;re able to accept that I don&rsquo;t believe that a licence violation will be a massive disincentive.</p>

<p>Similarly if people are not comitting a crime like fraud or money laundering, but are using automated tools to game the system by autmatically playing low-winning games for hours on end, for example, probably don&rsquo;t care about the EULA too much.</p>

<p>Finally, those who are seeking to reverse engineer the code to find exploits and attack the system in some way (ok this is also crime, but a different type) probably will not care about the EULA.</p>

<p>However&hellip;</p>

<p>Security researchers, for example, <b>are</b> likely to be dissuaded from taking a closer look at an application by a restrictive EULA, but they are the very people that we do not want to be dissuaded.  We want these people to find the problems and report them responsibly.  In a perfect world you would have a bug bounty program like those at <a href="https://www.etsy.com/ca/help/article/2463">Etsy</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/whitehat">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dn425036">Microsoft</a> to incentivize people to disclose bugs early and often.  But even without a formal bug bounty program in place dissuading researchers via the EULA could well lower your security posture.  Chances are that a resrictive EULA has just cut off their only option to report it to you responsibly without fear of some knee-jerk legal retaliation.  Instead, as <a href="https://twitter.com/essobi">@esSOBI</a> rightly points out:</p>

<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s time Information Security people engaged with Legal instead of dismissing the EULA on your product as &ldquo;business stuff&rdquo; and make sure that it isn&rsquo;t damaging your chances at a more secure product.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was meant to start this blog with a post about my ISP, about how they had man in the middle&rsquo;d my connection and how I had been working out the details of why they had been doing this, how they achieved it and how I uncovered what they had been up to.</p>

<p>Since I started writing that post the topic has grown somewhat and now I have been confirmed as a <a href="http://sector.ca/Program/Sessions/Session-Details/evl/0/tag/16752/Lee-Brotherston">speaker at SecTor 2014</a> in Toronto.</p>

<p>So, the post is still coming&hellip;  But if you want to see me explain it in as much Powerpoint glory as I can muster, come on down to SecTor later this year :)</p>
